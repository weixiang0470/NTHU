# **Covariance & Variance**
- Covariance show that the linear relationship between 2 data
    - If covariance is 0 or does not exist, only meaning that these 2 data does not have linear relationship. It does not confirm that these 2 data have no relationship at all.
- Variance show that the data distribution
    - If variance is big, meaning that the data is dispersion, if small means that the data is centralized.
