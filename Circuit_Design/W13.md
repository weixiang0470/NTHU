# **Talk1**
## **Computer vision**
- Algorithm to let computer understand the world capture by camera (image, video)
## **Lecture**
- 電容, for 暫存
- Inverter, even number of inverter will have stable memory function
    - 2 inverters result in **bistable circuit**
    - How to write(flip)
        1. Latch flipflop
            - 1 transmission gate to control input
            - 1 transmission gate to control feedback, feedback cut off
            - mux based latch

- Memory
    - shared data bus
    - shared control bus
