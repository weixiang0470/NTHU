# Design Steps
- Specification
    - functions, cost, etc
    - ex: a device can do `+-*/`
- Architecture
    - Large blocks
    - How to do `+-*/`(同步/非同步), use RTL(verilog,HDL)
- Logic
    - gates + registers
    - 邏輯實現的方式, how to make `+-*/` by logic gates + resisters, lesser gates/resistors -> better
- Circuits
    - how to make a single gate by transistor
    - transistor sizes for speed, power
- Layout
    - determines parasites
    - How to placed and wired using tool(CAD)
# Need to think about
- Functionality
    - one-bit binary full adder
- Technology
    - 1 um n-well CMOS technology
- Speed
    - input to ouput < 5us
- Area
    - $< 300um^2$
- Power Dissipation
